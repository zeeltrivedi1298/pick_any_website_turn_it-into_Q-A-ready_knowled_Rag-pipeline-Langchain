magine being able to pick any website and instantly turn it into a Q&amp;A-ready knowledge base.  Built a RAG app that can turn any website into a real-time Q&amp;A system.
🚀 Excited to share my recent AI hands-on: Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Application with LangChain!

🌐Imagine being able to pick any website and instantly turn it into a Q&A-ready knowledge base.

📌 Built a RAG app that can turn any website into a real-time Q&A system.
🚀 From URL to Knowledge Base: My project converts any website into an interactive AI assistant.
💡 What if you could ask questions directly from a live webpage? That’s what my RAG app does.
⚙️ Developed a LangChain + Azure OpenAI RAG pipeline that transforms websites into Q&A-ready datasets.
🔗 End-to-end AI project: Taking any website → embeddings → vector store → GPT-4 powered answers.

📌 Deployed GPT-4 & Text-Embedding-3-Large models via Azure OpenAI API
 📌 Created embeddings and stored them in a vector store for semantic search
 📌 Integrated a retrieval chain with LangChain for context-aware answers
 📌 Built a Gradio-powered UI to allow users to input a URL and query its content in real time
 📌 Worked hands-on with API endpoints, authentication keys, rate limits, and error handling

⚙️ Result: A working end-to-end RAG pipeline delivering accurate, real-time responses by combining retrieval + generation.

💡 Key skills strengthened:
API integration & authentication
Vectorization and embeddings workflow
RAG pipeline development with LangChain
Cloud-based AI deployment on Azure
