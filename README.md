# azureAI-openai-Rag-pipeline-Langchain  

🚀 Excited to share my recent **AI hands-on**: Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Application with **LangChain + Azure OpenAI**!  


🌐 Imagine being able to pick any website and instantly turn it into a **Q&A-ready knowledge base**.  

> **Note:** Results are stored in the `results/` folder.

## ✨ Highlights  

- 📌 Built a **RAG app** that can turn any website into a **real-time Q&A system**  
- 🚀 From **URL to Knowledge Base** → converts any website into an **interactive AI assistant**  
- 💡 Ask questions directly from a **live webpage**  
- ⚙️ Developed a **LangChain + Azure OpenAI RAG pipeline** that transforms websites into Q&A-ready datasets  
- 🔗 **End-to-end AI project**: Website → Embeddings → Vector Store → GPT-4 powered answers

## ⚙️ What I Did  

- 📌 Deployed **GPT-4** & **Text-Embedding-3-Large** models via **Azure OpenAI API**  
- 📌 Created **embeddings** and stored them in a **vector store** for semantic search  
- 📌 Integrated a **retrieval chain with LangChain** for context-aware answers  
- 📌 Built a **Gradio-powered UI** to allow users to input a URL and query its content in real time  
- 📌 Worked hands-on with **API endpoints, authentication keys, rate limits, and error handling**
